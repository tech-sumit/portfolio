## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are home robots actually useful yet?

Yes, for specific tasks. Robot vacuums are genuinely useful. General-purpose home robots (like LG CLOi) are launching in 2026—their utility will depend on execution.

### How much should I budget for a home robot?

- Basic robot vacuum: $300-600
- Premium robot vacuum: $1,000-1,800
- Advanced home robot: $2,000-5,000 (when available)

### Are humanoid robots coming to homes?

Not yet. Current humanoids are too expensive ($16,000+) and unproven for home use. Expect enterprise deployments first, homes in 5-10 years.

### Do robots spy on you?

This is a legitimate concern. Check:
- Data policies (what's uploaded vs. local)
- Camera/microphone controls
- Offline operation options
- Company data practices

### Which robot should I buy first?

Start with a robot vacuum. They're proven, affordable, and genuinely save time. Upgrade to more advanced robots as the technology matures.

## Conclusion

CES 2026 demonstrated that the robot revolution is no longer hypothetical—it's happening. From vacuums that climb stairs to humanoids that follow instructions, robots are becoming practical tools for homes and businesses.

The key developments:

1. **Home robots from major brands** (LG, Samsung) signal mainstream adoption
2. **Stair-climbing vacuums** (Saros Rover) eliminate a fundamental limitation
3. **Humanoids** are progressing from demos to deployments
4. **Healthcare robots** are addressing real needs

For consumers, 2026 is a great time to invest in robot vacuums and watch the emerging home robot category. For businesses, now is the time to evaluate robots for logistics, inspection, and customer service.

The future isn't just coming—it walked onto the CES show floor this year.
