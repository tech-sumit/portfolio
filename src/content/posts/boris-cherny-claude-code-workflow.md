## TL;DR - Key Takeaways

1. **Run 5-10 Claude agents in parallel** across terminal and browser
2. **Use Opus 4.5 with thinking mode** - slower but requires less steering
3. **Maintain a CLAUDE.md file** as shared memory for mistakes and conventions
4. **Plan first, execute second** - don't let AI start coding until the plan is solid
5. **Verification is non-negotiable** - every change must be tested

## The 10-Step Workflow

Let me break down each element of Boris's workflow and explain why it works.

### 1. Parallel Agent Instances

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I run 5 Claude Code instances in my terminal, each with its own git checkout. Plus 5-10 browser sessions on claude.ai/code. I can start on mobile and resume on desktop with --teleport.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

Boris runs **5-10 Claude agents simultaneously**:

| Setup | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 5 Terminal instances | Each with separate git checkout |
| 5-10 Browser sessions | Via claude.ai/code |
| Mobile sessions | Start on phone, resume on desktop |

**Why this works**: Different agents handle different concerns—one refactors, one writes tests, one updates docs. No merge conflicts because each has its own branch.

**How to implement**:
```bash
# Create multiple working directories
git worktree add ../project-refactor feature/refactor
git worktree add ../project-tests feature/tests
git worktree add ../project-docs feature/docs

# Run Claude Code in each
cd ../project-refactor && claude
cd ../project-tests && claude
cd ../project-docs && claude
```

### 2. Model Choice: Opus 4.5 with Thinking

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I use Opus 4.5 for everything with thinking mode enabled. Yes, it's slower. But it needs way less steering and produces better results. The time you save on corrections more than makes up for the speed difference.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

Boris exclusively uses **Opus 4.5** (not Sonnet) with **thinking mode always on**.

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | Steering Needed |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Sonnet | Fast | Good | More corrections |
| **Opus 4.5** | Slower | Better | Less steering |

**The insight**: Raw speed is a trap. A faster model that needs constant correction is slower than a deliberate model that gets it right the first time.

---

### 3. The CLAUDE.md File

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We maintain a CLAUDE.md in every repo. Whenever Claude makes a mistake, we add a rule about it. It's like a shared memory across all agents and team members. Updated every day.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

The **CLAUDE.md file** is the secret weapon. It's a living document of:

- Mistakes Claude should avoid
- Architectural preferences
- Naming conventions
- Project-specific patterns

**Example CLAUDE.md structure**:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - Project Guidelines

## Architecture
- Use functional components only
- State management via Zustand, not Redux
- All API calls go through /lib/api.ts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- Always handle loading and error states
- Never commit console.log statements

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Hooks: useCamelCase
- Utils: camelCase

## Testing
- Every component needs a test file
- Use React Testing Library, not Enzyme
```

### 4. PR Reviews Update CLAUDE.md

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">During code reviews, we tag @​claude to flag issues. A GitHub Action automatically updates CLAUDE.md with the new learnings. Mistakes caught in review become documented habits.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

The team has **automated learning** built into their PR process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[PR Created] --> B[Human Review]
    B --> C{Issue Found?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Tag @claude]
    D --> E[GitHub Action]
    E --> F[Update CLAUDE.md]
    F --> G[Future agents learn]
    C -->|No| H[Merge PR]
```

**This is organizational memory at scale**. Every mistake becomes a lesson for all future Claude sessions.

### 5. Plan Mode First

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I always start in Plan mode. Back and forth until the plan is solid. Only then do I switch to auto-accept for execution. Having a good plan means fewer missteps and wasted iterations.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

The workflow is **Plan → Refine → Execute**:

| Phase | Mode | Human Involvement |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| 1. Plan | Plan mode | High - back-and-forth |
| 2. Refine | Plan mode | Medium - clarifications |
| 3. Execute | Auto-accept | Low - monitoring |

**Why this matters**: Fixing a bad plan is cheap. Fixing bad code from a bad plan is expensive.

---

### 6. Slash Commands for Automation

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Repetitive workflows go into slash commands: /commit-push-pr, /run-tests, /format-all. Stored in .claude/commands/. Eliminates prompt engineering for common tasks.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

**Slash commands** turn common workflows into one-liners:

```
.claude/commands/
├── commit-push-pr.md
├── run-tests.md
├── format-all.md
├── deploy-staging.md
└── update-deps.md
```

**Example: commit-push-pr.md**
```markdown
# Commit, Push, and Create PR

1. Stage all changes
2. Generate commit message from diff
3. Push to current branch
4. Create PR with description from commits
5. Request review from team
```

---

### 7. Hooks for Continuous Automation

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PostToolUse hooks automatically format code after Claude writes it. Stop hooks handle long-running tasks. Hooks are like event listeners for Claude's actions.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

**Hooks** trigger automation at specific points:

| Hook Type | Trigger | Example Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| PostToolUse | After any tool runs | Auto-format code |
| PreToolUse | Before tool runs | Validate safety |
| Stop | When Claude stops | Run test suite |

---

### 8. Pre-Approved Permissions

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I pre-approve safe commands in .claude/settings.json. No more constant permission prompts for npm install, git commit, running tests. Makes sessions flow smoothly.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

**Example .claude/settings.json**:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "npm install",
      "npm run test",
      "npm run build",
      "git add",
      "git commit",
      "git push",
      "eslint --fix"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "rm -rf",
      "sudo",
      "npm publish"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 9. Tool Integrations

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Claude connects to Slack, BigQuery, Sentry, our internal tools via MCP. It's not just writing code—it's reading logs, querying data, posting updates. Config is shared in .mcp.json.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

Claude Code integrates with:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Slack** | Communication, status updates |
| **BigQuery** | Query production data |
| **Sentry** | Read error logs |
| **GitHub** | PR management |
| **Internal APIs** | Custom business logic |

---

### 10. Verification is #1

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My #1 tip: verification. Every change must be verified. Tests, browser checks, simulators. Without verification, errors creep in silently. This alone improves code quality 2-3x.</p>&mdash; Boris Cherny (@bcherny) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">January 2026</a></blockquote>

**Verification is non-negotiable**:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Claude writes code] --> B[Unit tests pass?]
    B -->|No| A
    B -->|Yes| C[Integration tests?]
    C -->|No| A
    C -->|Yes| D[Browser verification?]
    D -->|No| A
    D -->|Yes| E[Ready for review]
```

## What Could Be Improved

While Boris's workflow is impressive, there are areas for enhancement:

### 1. Better Agent Coordination

Currently, parallel agents are isolated. Future improvements could include:

- **Shared context** between agents
- **Automatic task delegation** based on agent specialization
- **Conflict detection** before branches diverge too far

### 2. Learning Across Projects

CLAUDE.md is per-repo. What if learnings could be:

- **Shared across similar projects** (all React apps, all Python services)
- **Company-wide mistake databases**
- **Industry-wide best practice libraries**

### 3. Smarter Verification Pipelines

Current verification is manual to set up. Improvements:

- **Auto-detect what needs testing** based on changes
- **Visual regression testing** without configuration
- **Performance impact analysis** before merge

### 4. Better Rollback and Recovery

When an agent goes wrong:

- **Automatic checkpoint** before major changes
- **One-click rollback** to last known good state
- **Blame-aware debugging** showing which agent introduced bugs

### 5. Cost Optimization

Running 10 Opus 4.5 instances is expensive. Potential improvements:

- **Dynamic model selection** based on task complexity
- **Agent hibernation** when idle
- **Batch processing** for similar tasks

## How to Apply This Today

You don't need to be at Anthropic to use these techniques:

### Starter Setup

1. **Create a CLAUDE.md** in your repo
2. **Set up git worktrees** for parallel work
3. **Create your first slash command**
4. **Configure permissions** in settings

### Minimum Viable Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create CLAUDE.md
echo "# Project Guidelines\n\n## Rules\n- Use TypeScript\n- Write tests" > CLAUDE.md

# 2. Create commands directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# 3. Create a simple command
echo "Stage, commit with conventional message, push, create PR" > .claude/commands/ship.md

# 4. Start with plan mode
claude --plan "Add user authentication feature"
```
