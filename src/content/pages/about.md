## About Me

Hey there! I'm Sumit Agrawal, a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of experience building innovative solutions that make a real difference. My journey in tech has been anything but ordinary – from architecting decentralized Web3 platforms to optimizing cloud infrastructures for billion-dollar enterprises.

Currently, I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at **Spheron Network**, where I'm helping shape the future of decentralized computing by developing Fizz Nodes and Provider Nodes that enable anyone to contribute to our distributed GPU network. It's exciting to be at the forefront of making AI workloads more accessible and efficient at the edge.

Beyond infrastructure, I've specialized in **AI Agent development** and **multi-agent systems**, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol to build sophisticated conversational AI solutions. My experience includes fine-tuning large language models, developing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, and creating intelligent systems that can collaborate and reason autonomously.

### My Tech Journey

My career has taken me through some incredible experiences – from leading technical teams at **Luganodes** where we managed over $1.2 billion in staking assets across 20+ blockchains, to building critical ride-sharing integrations at **Careem** after their Uber acquisition. I've also had the privilege of working with companies like **Spenmo**, **Delivery Hero**, and even founding my own company, **Profusion Technologies**.

What drives me is the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions. Whether I'm optimizing cloud costs by implementing Infrastructure as Code, building fraud detection systems for customer data platforms, or developing blockchain indexers for multiple protocols, I love finding that perfect balance between innovation and reliability.

### Beyond the Code

I'm not just about writing code – I'm passionate about the entire software development lifecycle. I believe in:

- **Clean Architecture**: Writing maintainable, scalable code that stands the test of time
- **Team Leadership**: Having mentored teams of 6+ engineers and guided them toward industry-leading practices
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying ahead of the curve with emerging technologies like AI/ML, Web3, and edge computing
- **Problem-Solving**: Approaching challenges with a solution-oriented mindset

### What I Love Working With

I'm particularly excited about projects involving:
- **AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems**: Building intelligent agents with Google's A2A protocol, developing autonomous systems that can collaborate and solve complex problems
- **AI Model Fine-tuning**: Customizing large language models for specific use cases, optimizing performance for domain-specific applications
- **MCP Server Development**: Creating Model Context Protocol servers that enable seamless integration between AI models and external data sources
- **Advanced AI & Machine Learning**: From OpenAI and Gemini APIs to RAG implementations, vector embeddings, and conversational AI platforms
- **Cloud-Native Solutions**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and building resilient microservices
- **Blockchain & Web3**: Ethereum, Cosmos SDK, Polkadot, and decentralized application development
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: CI/CD, monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, and Infrastructure as Code

### Let's Build Something Amazing

I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, collaboration, or just geeking out about technology. Whether you're looking to build intelligent AI agents, fine-tune models for your specific use case, develop MCP servers, scale your infrastructure, explore Web3 possibilities, or create multi-agent systems, I'd love to hear about your challenges and see how we can solve them together.

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
