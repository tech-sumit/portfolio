   - Go to your Medium profile (e.g., `medium.com/@johndoe`)
   - Use the part after `@` (e.g., `johndoe`)

2. **Set environment variable**:
   ```bash
   # Local development
   export MEDIUM_USERNAME=your_medium_username
   
   # Or add to GitHub Secrets for production
   MEDIUM_USERNAME=your_medium_username
   ```

3. **Enable in configuration** (optional, enabled by default):
   - Edit `src/config/blog.js` and ensure `showMediumPosts: true`

### Smart Environment Handling
